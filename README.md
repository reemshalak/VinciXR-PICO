VinciXR is a Mixed Reality (MR) drawing assistant built for the **Pico headset** during XR Bootcamp.

It helps users learn how to draw by projecting sketch guides into their real-world space and transforming drawings into interactive 3D models.

Built in **4 days** using only free tools and APIs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖍️ Image-to-sketch conversion
- 🎨 Color palette analysis
- 🧼 Automatic white background removal
- 🧱 Image-to-3D model generation
- 🌍 GLB model loading in Mixed Reality
- 🎯 Real-world sketch guidance


## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Engine
- Unity
- Pico SDK (adaptable to Meta Quest)

### APIs & Tools
- **LightX** – Image to Sketch
- **Gemini API** – Color Analysis
- **Tripo3D** – Image to 3D Model
- **UnityGLTF** – GLB Loading
- Custom Unity Shader – Background removal


## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload or select an image
2. Convert it into a sketch outline
3. Remove white background using shader
4. Analyze dominant colors
5. Generate a 3D model
6. Load and display the model in MR



## 🔮 Roadmap

- [ ] Animate generated 3D models
- [ ] Allow custom image uploads
- [ ] Real-time drawing suggestions
- [ ] Persistent spatial art (see previous drawings in your space)


## 📦 Project Status

🚧 Prototype – XR Bootcamp  
Actively under development.


## 💡 Vision
